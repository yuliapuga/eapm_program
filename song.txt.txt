sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on their chosen battle field

from the lines
shield by shield
some of us 
bla bls bla

latery i`ve been I've been losing sleep 
dreaming about thing that we could be
latery I've been I've been praying hard
Say no more counting dollars we`ll be we`ll be 
counting starts

latery i`ve been I've been losing sleep 
dreaming about thing that we could be
latery I've been I've been praying hard
Say no more counting dollars we`ll be we`ll be 
counting starts

sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on their chosen battle field

from the lines
shield by shield
some of us 
bla bls bla

It`s enough for this song 
Let`s make commit
